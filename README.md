# microsoft-iptables-only.py
Python script to query Microsoft's IP and domain list for allowlisting access to Microsoft's cloud services, and generate the output as a bash script containing the full set of iptables rules. Supports IPv6. Built this as a generic linux-friendly offshoot of a script to generate the allowlist request for one of the network service providers I deal with at work. 

# bobbytables.sh
Shell script output from the above.
